If you are following my Cert journey I would like to shed light into my process.
Because I started posting my notes and other things for my security cert towards the end of my process there was a lot of content quickly
For this exam it will not be the same case. I just got a job so that will be my number 1 priority.
My process starts with me hand writing my notes based on videos and creating review questions on the computer based on those notes.
I than do my review question and type out my notes.
I do self paced labs well redoing my review questions.
I use Whiz labs for exam simulators and make notes based on that.
I will take this section by section starting with ACloudGuru. Section 2 is based on Data stores so I expect review question, notes, and documentation on lab stuff out before I start my job on Monday.
After that it will be a slowed process. I will go through ACloudGuru, LinuxAcademy, WhizLabs, and other content suggested by instructors.
By the end of this year this part of my GitHub will be filled. I hope I can help all of you pass this cert.

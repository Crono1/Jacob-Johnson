This file section will be for ACloudGuru notes, labs, and question.
Also these sections may be out of order. I am going in the order of what is best for the AWS work I might do at my job.
Also because you are given about 3 Whitepapers to read in each section, the notes answering my questions may be late to come out.
This is due to how I take my notes with it first being written down and me later going back and typing them.

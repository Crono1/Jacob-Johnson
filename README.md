# Welcome
This repository is where I will be posting notes, review questions, and self made labs based on the certification I am studying. 
I like to share with the ACloudGuru community my notes from my AWS certifications.
Currently I am studying for the ITIL Foundational certification and the AWS Security Specialty. I expect full notes of both those exams in this repository by mid December.
As well as notes for those exams there is also my powerpoints I have presented for the AWS user group in Waco, Texas located here.
Feel free to browse around.
If you are curious about my coding ability, all my code will be located in the TSTC Automation repository as any code may prove helpful for the developement of that class.
